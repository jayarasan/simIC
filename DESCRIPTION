Description: 
    Provides tools to simulate and analyze interval-censored survival data, 
    including left-, right-, and uncensored cases, under common parametric 
    distributions such as Weibull, Exponential, Log-Normal, Log-Logistic, 
    Gamma, Gompertz, Normal, Logistic, and EMV. The package supports both 
    direct maximum likelihood estimation and imputation-based approaches, 
    making it suitable for methodological research, benchmarking, and teaching 
    purposes. An interactive web-based companion tool is also available.
